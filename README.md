# CAD Practice!

## Skateboard

We're building a skateboard. First, we started by building the deck, which was simple, and we also added some screw holes. Then, we worked with the trucks. One of the main objectives of this assignment was to work smarter not harder. We first started this part by building a basic square version of it (not accurate IRL), then we made some easy adjustemnts to that at the end to make it more like real trucks (angled). After this, a couple other simple parts and the board was done. We also changed the color, and it looks ike a pretty awesome skateboard in CAD.

### Reflection

The assignment itself wasn't too challenging. I'd give it a 5/10 on the challengeometer(definately didn't just make that up). I learned some cool new features like split and also a little bit on how to insert an image/logo. There were some spots that I had to go back and redo because of accidental extra relations or dimensions. At the end, something went wrong and there was some problems with the baseplate, but that problem was quicly terminated by Mr.H. I learned a good amount from this assignment on how to think about CAD & 3d modeling. Overall, this assingnment is a 72% on Rotten Filaments.

## Legooo

### Description

I made a lego. An actual lego. Crazy. Whats more crazier is that I made only *ONE* lego, but I can make any type of lego I want with a click. Let me start off by saying that configurations are pretty awesome. You can make 1 of something and be able to have many different options of sizes, colors, or configurations of it in a dropdown menu. The first one will be a little longer and complicated, and might take more time, but the rest will literally take < min each. I've made a couple different configurations for my lego brick. I started by making a basic 2x4 brick, and then from that I made configurations of the height(brick, tile, etc.), length, width, and color. I have maybe 64 different options from 1 brick I made so far that can range from a 1x1 tile to a 4x2 brick with colors Red, Blue, and Yellow. This is just what I did. I could make add as many configurations of color as I want to have any color lego available at my command.

### Reflection

This was an awesome assignment because I learned some really helpful features for CAD modeling to come. Configurations are definitely worth learning so that you can have multiplt different types of one product at your disposal. I think that variables are also an important feature when working woth configurations. The main thing is to make sure that most of your dimensions have variability, and it can be easily switched. Over all solid learning experience - 70% on Rotten Filaments.

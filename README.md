# Skateboard


We're building a skateboard. First, we started by building the deck, which was simple, and we also added some screw holes. Then, we worked with the trucks. One of the main objectives of this assignment was to work smarter not harder. We first started this part by building a basic square version of it (not accurate IRL), then we made some easy adjustemnts to that at the end to make it more like real trucks (angled). After this, a couple other simple parts and the board was done. We also changed the color, and it looks ike a pretty awesome skateboard in CAD.

## Reflection

The assignment itself wasn't too challenging. I'd give it a 5/10 on the challengeometer(definately didn't just make that up). I learned some cool new features like split and also a little bit on how to insert an image/logo. There were some spots that I had to go back and redo because of accidental extra relations or dimensions. At the end, something went wrong and there was some problems with the baseplate, but that problem was quicly terminated by Mr.H. I learned a good amount from this assignment on how to think about CAD & 3d modeling. Overall, this assingnment is a 72% on Rotten Filaments.
